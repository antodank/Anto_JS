How the function is invoked determines the value of this inside the function

When a regular function is invoked, the value of this is the global window object

If a constructor function is called with the new operator, the value of this is set to the newly-created object. 
If a method is invoked on an object, this is set to that object itself. 
And if a function is simply invoked, this is set to the global object: window.
