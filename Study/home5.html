        async - html parser finishes its task
                async execution starts
                html parser finished
                documnet onload fired
                async execution completed
                
                so in async we cant be sure js are loaded before onloaad of document 
                and also prone to error if js execution needs to be ordered

        defer - html parser start
                html paser end
                defer execution completes
                document onload executed

                so in defer approach we can be sured that all js are loaded in ordered manner
                before document onload fired
